What is one thing that I learned from being in a relationship?
That love is not so simple.
Love is not just caring for someone.
It is not just a feeling.
It is the actions you have taken.
The time you have spent.
The highs and the lows.
And above all, the perseverance to be able to forget, forgive, and move on.
Love encompasses all aspects of emotions you may never expect.
That is why love is complex.
